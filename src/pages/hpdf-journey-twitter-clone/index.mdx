I took the [**Introduction to Modern Application Development course** ](https://nptel.ac.in/courses/106/106/106106156/)which was being jointly offered by IIT Madras and [Hasura](http://hasura.io). I was new to web development and app development. But I grasped all the concepts taught to us in the 8 week course quite easily, thanks to the amazing teaching style of Tanmai Sir along with others, while doing a handful of practical exercises. An NPTEL online exam was held and top 5%(~400) students were selected for the [Hasura Product Development Fellowship](https://blog.hasura.io/go-from-an-idea-to-an-mvp-with-hasura-28f941c52076). And to my joy, I was also selected for the fellowship as I was in top 2%.

We were allotted Front End and Back End Technologies to work on. I got Front End ([React](https://reactjs.org)) which I had given as my preference. I was quite interested in learning a frontend library which was completely new to me.

I got the first task to create the [twitter main timeline page](http://twitter.com) and [twitter search results page](https://twitter.com/search?q=aadhaar), using [material-ui ](http://material-ui.com). At first, it was quite difficult for me to get hold of [JSX](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/React_(JavaScript_library)#JSX>). But slowly, I understood it by following various tutorials online and researching on my own (StackOverflow and Google are your friends!). Then came the part of using material-ui. I was quite amazed by the material design and became used to the library quite easily thanks to its good documentation.

I was able to complete the task on time and this is the final result.

We were then divided into teams of 3 and given projects to complete.

> I won the Pub2Hub challenge held during the programme. Finally, I successfully completed my project and was awarded the “[Distinguished High Performer](https://bit.ly/geekysrm-high-performer)” award.

You can contact me in case of any doubts on my [twitter,](https://twitter.com/geekysrm) [linkedin ](https://linkedin.com/in/geekysrm)or [telegram](https://t.me/geekysrm). I will try my best to clear your doubts.
