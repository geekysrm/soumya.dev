I was amazed by the stuff one can do using
[Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com). I watched in awe the [live
streams](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7CcGwsqRpSMgVc5NxXUpqmGOS9s1YrWF)
of [Adam Wathan](https://twitter.com/adamwathan) (creator of tailwindcss) where
he used to build various layouts using tailwindcss, without using any custom
CSS.

Not being a great designer by myself, I decided to give TailwindCSS a try. Being a React developer, I wanted to try tailwind with React.

Then, I was starting with a [Gatsby ](https://gatsbyjs.org)site, I thought why not use tailwind with this. I also wanted to use it with a CSS-in -JS solution like [Emotion ](https://emotion.sh)or [styled-components](https://styled-components.com) being a big fan of CSS-in-JS. I googled a lot, tried different starters and here I am with what I can tell the **_‚Äúbest _**üëå**_‚Äù_ way to use TailwindCSS with Gatsby along with CSS-in-JS solutions like Emotion or styled-components.**

## Steps to get the perfect üëåcombo:

- Run the following command on your terminal to get a default Gatsby site up and running.

```shell
npx gatsby new your-gatsby-site
```

- Run `gatsby develop` on your terminal to open your site on **port 8000 **(default).
  You can view your site with live reload (updates site as you edit and save code).

- Install Tailwind and generate [Tailwind config file](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/configuration/#creating-your-configuration-file).
  ( To learn more about how to use Tailwind in your CSS, visit the [Tailwind Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation#3-use-tailwind-in-your-css))

```shell
# Install Tailwind:
npm install tailwindcss --save-dev

# Generate Tailwind config:
npx tailwind init
```

Now you can use tailwind classes in your project using `className` attribute. But to use CSS-in-JS magic and styled components pattern, follow the below steps.

- Now install _Emotion packages, tailwind-micro, gatsby-plugin-postcss, postcss-preset-env, postcss-import, [stylelint](https://stylelint.io/)_:

```shell
npm i @emotion/core @emotion/styled tailwind.macro@next gatsby-plugin-postcss postcss-import postcss-preset-env
# We are installing the 'next' version of tailwind micro so as to use TailwindCSS 1.0.0+
# For older versions of TailwindCSS, just install 'tailwind.macro'
```

- Create a file `postcss.config.js` in the root of your project with the following content:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    require("postcss-import")({
      plugins: [require("stylelint")],
    }),
    require("tailwindcss")("./tailwind.config.js"),
    require("postcss-preset-env")({
      autoprefixer: { grid: true },
      features: {
        "nesting-rules": true,
      },
      browsers: ["> 1%", "last 2 versions", "Firefox ESR"],
    }),
  ],
};
```

- Add `gatsby-plugin-postcss` and `gatsby-plugin-emotion` to your `gatsby-config.js` file:

```javascript
plugins: [
  ...
    {
      resolve: `gatsby-plugin-postcss`,
      options: {
        // Accepts all options defined by `gatsby-plugin-postcss` plugin.
      },
    },
   {
      resolve: `gatsby-plugin-emotion`,
      options: {
        // Accepts all options defined by `babel-plugin-emotion` plugin.
      },
    },
    ...
  ],
```

- Restart Gatsby dev server using `Ctrl+C` and again running `gatsby develop` .
  Now our gatsby site knows about the plugins we have installed.

- To use default Tailwind base styles and utilities styles, create a globals.css file. I like to keep it in `src/styles/globals.css` :

```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind utilities;
```

- Now to use the `globals.css` styles, we import it in the `gatsby-browser.js` file in our root directory:

```javascript
// Edit the path to where you have kept the globals.css file
import "./src/styles/globals.css";
```

- Restart Gatsby dev server using `Ctrl+C` and again running `gatsby develop` .

## Usage üíª

Finally, we are done with all installation and configuration. Whew!
We can now use the tailwind classes quite easily in our components in 3 ways:

_a._ _Using tailwind classes directly in markup:_

```jsx
import React from "react";
import tw from "tailwind.macro";

const MyComponent = (
  <h4 css={tw`font-semibold text-lg leading-snug truncate`}>This is Soumya</h4>
);

export default MyComponent;
```

Here, the tailwind classes `font-semibold`, `text-lg`, `leading-snug`, `truncate` will be applied to `h4` tag.

_b. Using styled components pattern:_

```jsx
import React from "react";
import tw from "tailwind.macro";

const MyComponent = tw.div`
  bg-white
  rounded-lg
  overflow-hidden
  border
`;

export default MyComponent;
```

_c. In case you want to apply custom CSS along with some TailwindCSS properties:_

```jsx
import React from "react";
import tw from "tailwind.macro";
import styled from "@emotion/styled";

const MyComponent = styled.div`
  ${tw`bg-white
  rounded-lg
  overflow-hidden
  border`}
  height: 409px;
  img {
    height: 265px;
    object-fit: cover;
    object-position: center;
  }
`;

export default MyComponent;
```

Tip: To quickly refer Tailwind classes, use [TailwindCSS cheatsheet](https://nerdcave.com/tailwind-cheat-sheet) üìù.

That‚Äôs it! Congratulations! üéâ
You have successfully setup a Gatsby site that uses TailwindCSS along with Emotion.

Suggestions and comments are welcome!
